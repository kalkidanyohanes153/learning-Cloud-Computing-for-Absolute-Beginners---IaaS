DAY 1
What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud") instead of using local servers or personal devices.
What Is Digital Transformation?
Digital transformation refers to the integration of digital technologies into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how it operates and delivers value to customers.
Clould Computing as Digital Transformation
Cloud computing plays a central role in digital transformation by enabling businesses and organizations to become more agile, scalable, and innovative. Here's a clear explanation of how cloud computing supports digital transformation:
Core Components of Cloud Computing:
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Instead of buying and managing physical servers and data centers, you rent these resources on-demand from a cloud provider.
Example: Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure VM
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
provides a platform for developers to build, test, deploy, and manage applications—without managing the underlying infrastructure like servers, networks, or storage.
Example: Google App Engine, a developer builds a blog website using Heroku.
Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS  is a cloud computing model where software applications are delivered over the internet. Instead of installing software on your computer, you can access it any time through a web browser or app, usually by subscription.
Example: Gmail, Microsoft 365, Zoom
FaaS (Function as a Service)
FaaS  is a cloud computing model under serverless architecture where developers write individual functions (small blocks of code) that are executed in response to events, without managing servers
Types of Cloud Deployment Models
Public Cloud :Cloud services are delivered over the internet and shared among multiple users. Resources like storage and servers are owned and operated by third-party providers.	Examples Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud
Private Cloud :Cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by a single organization. It can be hosted on-site or by a third-party, but all resources are private.	 Examples Company-owned data centers, IBM Cloud Private.
Hybrid Cloud	:Combines public and private clouds to allow data and applications to move between them. Offers more flexibility and optimization.	Examples a business runs sensitive data in a private cloud and uses public cloud for less critical operations.
Hyperscale Public Cloud Providers?
Hyperscale cloud providers are large tech companies that offer massive, scalable cloud computing platforms with global infrastructure. These companies provide the computing power, storage, and networking capacity needed to support millions of users and large-scale enterprise applications.Example Amazon,Google.
What Are Underutilized Physical Servers?
servers in a data center or IT environment that consume power, space, and cooling resources but are not being used to their full capacity.The solution is Virtualization and Cloud Migration.
 Virtualization with Virtual Machines (VMs)
Virtualization with Virtual Machines is one of the most common ways to implement virtualization. It involves running multiple virtual computers (VMs) on a single physical machine using a hypervisor.
What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?
A Virtual Machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. Each VM has its own operating system (OS), applications, CPU, memory, and storage—just like a real computer.
What is a Hypervisor?
A hypervisor—also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)—is specialized software or firmware that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical host.It allows multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on one physical computer by sharing the hardware resources like CPU, RAM, storage, and network.
A VM image (Virtual Machine image) is a pre-configured template that contains everything needed to launch a virtual machine. This includes:
An operating system (like Windows, Linux), Pre-installed software or applications,Configuration files and settings,System libraries and dependencies
A hypervisor performs several critical tasks to enable and manage virtualization. First, it handles the creation, operation, and deletion of virtual machines (VMs), allowing multiple VMs to run on a single physical host. It is responsible for the allocation of hardware resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage to each VM, ensuring efficient and fair distribution. The hypervisor also ensures isolation between VMs, so that each one operates independently and securely without interfering with others. Through hardware abstraction, it presents virtual hardware to the VMs, hiding the complexities and specifics of the underlying physical components. Additionally, the hypervisor continuously monitors VM performance, enabling administrators to optimize system performance and perform load balancing when necessary. Lastly, it supports VM mobility and management features like cloning, snapshots, backups, and live migration, which enhance flexibility, disaster recovery, and system availability.
Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling in Cloud Computing
Scaling refers to the ability of a system to handle increased demand by adjusting its resources.
 Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up) means increasing the capacity of a single server or VM by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage.
Pros:
Simple to implement
No changes needed in application logic
Good for monolithic applications
Cons:
There's a limit to how much a single machine can be upgraded
May require downtime to resize the machine
Becomes expensive at higher levels
 Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out) means adding more machines (servers or VMs) to distribute the load.
Pros:
No upper limit—scales to meet high demand
Provides redundancy and high availability
Ideal for cloud-native and microservices-based apps
Cons:
More complex to manage (e.g., sync data, load balancing)
Requires applications to support distributed architecture
