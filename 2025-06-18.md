Why IAAS?
What's the business case of using the IAAS in a public cloud?
Using IaaS in a public cloud offers businesses a smart and flexible way to manage IT resources. It reduces costs by eliminating the need to buy and maintain hardware, allowing companies to pay only for what they use. It also provides fast, on-demand scalability, letting businesses grow or shrink resources easily. With quick setup and deployment, teams can move faster and focus more on innovation rather than managing infrastructure. Public cloud IaaS offers global access, high availability, and built-in disaster recovery. It includes strong security tools and supports compliance needs. Most importantly, it keeps your infrastructure up to date with the latest technology, unlike private systems which can become outdated over time
Compute ,Storage and Networking
Compute refers to the processing power that runs applications and services.In IaaS, this is typically provided via Virtual Machines (VMs).These VMs run on the cloud provider’s physical servers but are isolated environments for each user.Examples:Amazon EC2 (AWS),Azure Virtual Machines,Google Compute Engine
Key Features:
Customizable: Choose your operating system (Linux, Windows), number of CPUs, RAM, and storage.
Scalable: Can scale up/down or auto-scale based on workload (e.g., high traffic).
Use cases: Hosting websites, databases, software development, data analysis.
Storage in IaaS means you can store data remotely — no need for on-premise hard drives or file servers.Data is stored across multiple disks and locations to ensure redundancy and durability.Examples:Amazon S3 (Object), EBS (Block),Azure Blob Storage,Google Cloud Storage
Types of Storage:
Block Storage	:Like a virtual hard drive it used by VMs	Storing databases, apps
Object Storage:Stores unstructured data like files, images, videos	Backups, media, logs
File Storage:Shared file system accessed like a network drive	Enterprise file shares
