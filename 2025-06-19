DHCP
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other related parameters(Subnet mask,Default gateway and lease time).
 Install the DHCP Server Role
When setting up DHCP on a Windows Server, IPv4 is usually pre-configured or commonly used. Here's why IPv4 is the most commonly used, and what's going on with IPv6:
1. IPv4 is still the dominant protocol
Most networks, devices, and systems today still rely on IPv4.
IPv4 addresses (like 192.168.1.1) are simpler and more familiar.
It's still the standard in most small to medium-sized networks.
2. IPv6 has different configuration needs
IPv6 uses a different method called SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto Configuration) — meaning devices can configure themselves without a DHCP server.
DHCPv6 is optional and not always needed in modern networks.
Many routers and client systems use RA (Router Advertisement) for IPv6 configuration.
3. Windows DHCP by default focuses on IPv4
During setup, IPv4 is presented because it’s the standard in most deployments.
You can manually configure IPv6 scopes, but it's not required in most cases, especially on local area networks (LANs).
Want to Enable IPv6 DHCP?
You can:
Create an IPv6 scope manually in the DHCP console.
Ensure IPv6 routing and Router Advertisement Daemon (RADVD) is configured if on Linux.
Use DHCPv6 for stateful configuration (if SLAAC is disabled).
DNS
It translates domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.36) that computers use to communicate.

Root Server (A-M, 13 logical servers)
It’s the top-level of the DNS hierarchy.There are 13 logical root servers, labeled A to M (e.g., a.root-servers.net, b.root-servers.net, ...).Each logical server has many physical servers 
spread globally for speed & redundancy.It doesn't store domain IPs like google.com, but knows where to find the TLD (.com, .org, etc.) servers.
“Ask the .com TLD server at this address.”
  ↓
TLD Server (.com, .net, .org)
“Go ask the Authoritative DNS at this address.”

Authoritative Server (google.com DNS)
The final source of truth for a domain.Owned by the domain owner (e.g., Google, Facebook).Contains DNS records, including:A record (IPv4 address), AAAA record (IPv6 address)
MX record (mail server), CNAME (alias), NS (nameserver).
“It’s 142.250.190.36”
