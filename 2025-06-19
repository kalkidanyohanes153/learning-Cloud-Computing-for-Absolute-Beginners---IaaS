AD
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks.It stores information about users, computers, printers, groups, and other objects in 
a network, and manages security policies, authentication, and access control.
Logical Structure of Active Directory
a. Forest
The highest level in the AD hierarchy.A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees that share:
A common schema (data structure)
A global catalog
Trusts between domains
Usually represents the entire organization.
 Example: An enterprise called GlobalCorp may have one forest named globalcorp.com.
b. Tree
A collection of domains that share a contiguous namespace (e.g., hr.globalcorp.com, it.globalcorp.com).Domains in a tree are automatically trusted by each other (two-way trust).

c. Domain
A security boundary that stores objects like:Users, Computers, Groups, Organizational Units.Each domain has its own policies, authentication rules, and database (NTDS.dit).
The domain is the most commonly managed unit.
Example: sales.globalcorp.com is one domain.
d. Organizational Unit (OU)
A container within a domain used to organize objects (users, computers) logically.Policies (GPOs) can be applied to OUs.Delegation of control is possible at OU level.
Example: You can have OU=Students, OU=Teachers, etc.
e. Objects üîπ
Everything stored in AD is an object.Object types: User, Group, Computer, Printer, Shared Folder, etc.Each object has a unique Distinguished Name (DN) and a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).
f. Schema üß¨
The rules or blueprint that defines what objects can exist in AD and what attributes they have.
Example: A "User" object has attributes like username, email, password.
 3. What is a Domain Controller (DC)?
What is a Domain Controller (DC)?
A Domain Controller is a server that runs AD DS (Active Directory Domain Services.DC is a Windows Server that stores and manages a copy of the Active Directory database and provides the core services for:
User authentication
Security policy enforcement
Directory searches
Replication of AD data to other DCs
The DC is the brain of a Windows-based network ‚Äî it controls who can log in, what they can access, and applies rules (GPOs) to manage behavior.

It authenticates users, stores the AD database, and enforces security policies.
Functions:
Stores a writable copy of the AD database (NTDS.dit)
Handles logins, password changes, and security policies
Processes Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
Replicates changes to other DCs
Every domain must have at least one DC, and large environments may have many DCs for redundancy.
4. What is a Global Catalog (GC)?
The Global Catalog is a specialized role that can be enabled on a DC.
Functions:
Stores a partial replica of all objects in the entire forest (not just one domain).
Allows forest-wide searches (e.g., "Find all users named John across all domains").
Used during logon to verify Universal Group Membership.
Usually, the first DC in the forest becomes a Global Catalog server.





DHCP
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other related parameters(Subnet mask,Default gateway and lease time).
 Install the DHCP Server Role
When setting up DHCP on a Windows Server, IPv4 is usually pre-configured or commonly used. Here's why IPv4 is the most commonly used, and what's going on with IPv6:
1. IPv4 is still the dominant protocol
Most networks, devices, and systems today still rely on IPv4.
IPv4 addresses (like 192.168.1.1) are simpler and more familiar.
It's still the standard in most small to medium-sized networks.
2. IPv6 has different configuration needs
IPv6 uses a different method called SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto Configuration) ‚Äî meaning devices can configure themselves without a DHCP server.
DHCPv6 is optional and not always needed in modern networks.
Many routers and client systems use RA (Router Advertisement) for IPv6 configuration.
3. Windows DHCP by default focuses on IPv4
During setup, IPv4 is presented because it‚Äôs the standard in most deployments.
You can manually configure IPv6 scopes, but it's not required in most cases, especially on local area networks (LANs).
Want to Enable IPv6 DHCP?
You can:
Create an IPv6 scope manually in the DHCP console.
Ensure IPv6 routing and Router Advertisement Daemon (RADVD) is configured if on Linux.
Use DHCPv6 for stateful configuration (if SLAAC is disabled).
DNS
It translates domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.36) that computers use to communicate.

Root Server (A-M, 13 logical servers)
It‚Äôs the top-level of the DNS hierarchy.There are 13 logical root servers, labeled A to M (e.g., a.root-servers.net, b.root-servers.net, ...).Each logical server has many physical servers 
spread globally for speed & redundancy.It doesn't store domain IPs like google.com, but knows where to find the TLD (.com, .org, etc.) servers.
‚ÄúAsk the .com TLD server at this address.‚Äù

Authoritative Server (google.com DNS)
The final source of truth for a domain.Owned by the domain owner (e.g., Google, Facebook).Contains DNS records, including:A record (IPv4 address), AAAA record (IPv6 address)
MX record (mail server), CNAME (alias), NS (nameserver).
